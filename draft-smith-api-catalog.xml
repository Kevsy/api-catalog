			<name>Introduction</name>
			<t>A Web host may publish Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to encourage requests for interaction from  external parties. Such APIs must be discovered before they may be used - i.e., the external party needs to know what APIs a given Web host exposes, including their purpose, any constraints to use, and the endpoints to interact with the APIs. To faciliate discovery of this information, this document proposes a well-known URI, 'api-catalog', as a location where a Web host's API endpoints are listed and described.</t>
			<section anchor="goals">
				<name>Goals and non-goals</name>
				<t>The primary goal is to facilitate the discovery of both a Web Host's public API endpoints, and metadata that informs the potential API client of the purpose of each API and any constraints around usage.</t>
				<t>Non-goals: this document does not mandate paths for API endpoints. i.e., it does not mandate that my_example_api should be available at example.com/.well-known/api-catalog/my_example_api (although it is not forbidden to do so).</t>

			<name>Using the 'api-catalog' well-known URI</name>
			<t>The api-catalog well-known URI is intended for HTTP(S) servers that publish APIs and wish to facilitate their discovery. Since the purpose of the api-catalog well-known URI is to facilitate API discovery with minimal prior knowledge, it is recommended that /.well-known/api-catalog be hosted at a predictable hostname, i.e. www.example.com . It may also be hosted at other hostnames, e.g. api.example.com, developer.example.com etc.</t>
			<t>A Web host (example.com) supporting this URI:</t>
			<ul>
				<li>SHALL resolve an HTTP(S) GET request to /.well-known/api-catalog and return a linkset </li>
				<li>SHOULD resolve an HTTP(S) HEAD request to /.well-known/api-catalog with a response including a Link header with the relation(s) defined in 
					<xref target="LINK-RELATION" />.
				
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section anchor="MEDIA-TYPE">
			<name>Associated Media type: the api-catalog linkset </name>
			<t>A request to the api-catalog well-known URI SHALL return a linkset <xref target="RFC9264"/> containing an array of links with the link relation "api-bookmarks" and an anchor representing the entity hosting the APIs.   Following each link SHOULD return a machine-readable description of the API with sufficient information to decide if, and understand how, to use the API. (Editor's note: we can recommend the format for this machine-readble description, e.g. https://restdesc.org/)</t>
